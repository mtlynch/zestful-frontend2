    <h2>
      Term and Termination
    </h2>

    <p>
      The rights duties and obligations under these Terms shall commence on the
      date upon which you agree to these Terms and shall continue until such
      time as you discontinue using the Zestful API or Zestful terminates your
      access to the APIs, Zestful terminates this agreement, or both. Zestful
      reserves the right to discontinue the availability of the Zestful API at
      any time, for any reason whatsoever. We may also impose limits on certain

      or our website. All of our rights in these Terms may be exercised without

    </p>
    <p>
      Zestful reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or
      terminate your use of the Zestful API at any time if we believe you have
      violated these Terms or, if Zestful, at its sole discretion, determines
      the use or access to the Zestful API by you or your application is
      inconsistent with Zestfulâ€™s business interests or the interests of any
      users. In the event this agreement between you and Zestful under these
      Terms is terminated for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to you
      under these Terms shall immediately cease and terminate with no further
      effect. You agree that Zestful shall bear no liability by virtue of
      terminating this agreement.
